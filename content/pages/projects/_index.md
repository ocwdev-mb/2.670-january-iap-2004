"Engineers, Start Your Engines!"
--------------------------------

Join us for the ninth annual spinoff!!  
Day 10 (In Lab)

**Every IAP, students in 2.670 build 160 working Stirling Engines.**

2.670 gives sophomores in the mechanical engineering department at MIT an introduction to basic machine shop tools, CAD drawing, and MATLABÂ® fundamentals. The course was originally developed to teach basic skills used in future, core classes in the department, but it's become an annual institution at the Institute - with students from across MIT signing up each year for the chance to build their own, working Stirling engines!

The spin-off is **almost** as fun as the class itself. Students race to find the fastest engines and vote to select the most aesthetically pleasing modifications. We hope you'll be able to join us this year!
