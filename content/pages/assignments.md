A step-by-step walk through of the first assignment will help finishing this homework assignment on your own. This is the on-line version of the notes handed out in class. You need to turn in two graphs by the end of the first day of MATLAB® class period ({{% resource_link c5c23259-4777-fbcd-ba35-6a61fb7ad1ae "PDF" %}})  
  
As detailed, these graphs include

*   A one page printout of the MATLAB® output of the force to displacement matrix, the forces, and maximum weight a recent 2.007 machine could lift with air cylinders ({{% resource_link 7e76328f-7bd0-6224-e4bd-a61e28efcfc2 "PDF" %}})
*   A graph solution to a second order forced single d.o.f. oscillator ({{% resource_link 0827daad-1c70-d4f1-f1a5-9836749594a9 "PDF" %}})

An step-by-step tutorial to walk through the last MATLAB® assignment was also handed out as notes. Complete the tasks, and turn in the resulting two graphs by the end of the third day of your MATLAB® class periods ({{% resource_link b60e82de-d019-61a3-1049-c39984aab0e3 "PDF" %}})  
  
The assignment is to create two graphs of a numerical o.d.e. solution

*   A first order temperature cooling equation ({{% resource_link da00cef4-b578-fd75-82d1-25c85ab3fe9b "PDF" %}})
*   A second order single degree of freedom oscillator equation ({{% resource_link de8f704b-cfd9-9423-750a-afcb25098593 "PDF" %}})

Note there is no lecture on MATLAB® Day 3, but rather you are to work on your own to solve Problem Set 3.
